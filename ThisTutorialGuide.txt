1. Create requirement.txt file
    a. First install pipreqs libraray which will generate the requirements.txt file.
    b. pipreqs ./ - This will create a requirements.txt file which will contain all the libraries used and will not include the optional dependancy libraries
2. Create a normal text file and name is as setup.txt, once you paste the contents shown in the reference link save and rename the file as setup.shown
3. Create a normal text file and name is as Procfile.txt and add the command - web: sh setup.sh && streamlit run app.py (remember the file name should be same as our main py file name here app.py), save nd rename it as just Procfile instead of Procfile.txt as it should not have any extension
4. Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads - by default installed in mac
5. In the StreamlitHeroku demo we had directly published the code to Heroku git, now here we will push the code to our git repo and link it in Heroku.

10. Push your files to git
    a. git add .
